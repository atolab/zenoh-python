============

The *zenoh-python* library provides a Python `zenoh client API <zenoh-api.html>`_ for zenoh.

An introduction to zenoh and its concepts is available on `zenoh.io <https://zenoh.io>`_.

Note that this library also provides a low-level API (`zenoh-net <zenoh-net-api.html>`_)
that gives access to the zenoh protocol primitives and allow some
advanced use cases where a fine tuning of the protocol is required.
